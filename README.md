# Tesla Info Screen

Simple web site that can be shown on a Tesla Model S or Model X screen showing details about the vehicle.

This repo is tuned for the Model S 85D, feel free to fork and customize to your own needs.

## Customizing

### Vehicle Badge

I added badges for most of the Model S (and X) versions, you can simply replace the reference to `85d.svg` with your car's model. If I don't have the model, or it doesn't work in the Tesla right, I'd just delete the `<img>` tag and use text, since the SVGs are pretty finicky.

### Car Name

At the top-right I included the name of my car (_Quicksilver_), you can replace this with anything you want or simply remove it.
